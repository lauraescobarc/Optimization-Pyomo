In my case, I have chosed this type of problem, but I have also based it in the *Minimum Cost Flow Problem*. In fact, its base is practically the same as the algorithm searches for the combination of decision variables that gives the minimum cost. The differnt part is the definition of the constraints (and the needed sets and parameters) that add an extra difficulty to the mentioned problem. Although the data is not real (I invented the values), the result and conclusion of the problem is quite realistic if we look to a real case. The products are sent to the clients with the journey with less, we try to not overpass the capacities of the factories and stores and the customer's demand is satisfied.\n",

Although, and making some constructive critisim, I would loved to prepare a more complex problem (not in size data, I am talking about more complex constraints), I have to addmit that I am satisfied as it is based on a real problem and it achieves the objective statement: create a non-lineal objective function and one non trivial constraint. I have achieved that and I created more than one non trivial constraint."
